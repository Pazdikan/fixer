# What's planned for the game?

You play as a [fixer](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Fixer). Starting out as an unknown, you use social media to find people in need of help. You complete your first job (code name: gig) to earn some street cred. Eventually, people start reaching out to you directly.

With the hard earned money, you build your own team of mercenaries - individuals willing to take on risky jobs for cash. Each character in your world has unique skills, traits, and personalities.

# About development and future releases

Once I manage to create a reasonably playable version of the game, it will be released as v1.0.0 - the first release.

After the initial v1.0.0 version, I'll create a "development" branch where all new commits will go. Once everything in that branch is stable, it will be merged into the master branch and tagged with a new version number.

# How to contribute

Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

All contributors will be acknowledged in the game. Thanks in advance!

# Why keep this repository public?

Why not? The game probably won't get much attention, but if someone finds it, they might want to help by playtesting or even contributing.
