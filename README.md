# What's planned for the game?
You'll play as a [fixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)). Starting out unknown, you’ll use social media to find people in need of help. You’ll complete your first job (code name: gig) to earn some recognition (code name: creed).

Eventually, people will start reaching out to you instead. You can also build your own team of mercenaries - individuals willing to take on dirty jobs for cash. Each human in this generated world will have unique skills, traits and personalities.

# Why keep this repository public?
Why not? The game probably won’t get much attention, but if someone finds it, they can help out by playtesting or maybe even contributing.

# How to contribute?
The best way to help right now is to play the game and fill out [issues](https://github.com/Pazdikan/fixer/issues). I'm not looking for coding help at the moment, but if you’re enjoying the game, translating it could be a great way to contribute.

All contributions will be acknowledged in the game. Thanks in advance!

# Tech stack
The tech stack is pretty basic:
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build
