# What's planned for the game?
You'll play as a [fixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)). Starting out as an unknown, you'll use social media to find people in need of help. You'll complete your first job (code name: gig) to earn some recognition (code name: cred).

Eventually, people will start reaching out to you directly. You can also build your own team of mercenaries—individuals willing to take on risky jobs for cash. Each character in this procedurally generated world will have unique skills, traits, and personalities.

# About development and future releases
Once I manage to create a reasonably playable version of the game, it will be released as version 0.1.0—the very first release.

After the initial (0.1.0) version, I'll create a "development" branch where all new commits will go. Once everything in that branch is stable, it will be merged into the master branch and tagged with a new version number.

# How to contribute
The best way to help right now is to play the game and either report new issues or provide additional information on [existing issues](https://github.com/Pazdikan/fixer/issues). I'm not looking for coding help at the moment (at least until the first playable build), but if you're enjoying the game, contributing a translation could be a great way to help.

> [!WARNING]  
> Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) guidelines! This helps with generating a changelog and keeping the codebase organized.  
> Example: `feat: Add Polish translation`

All contributors will be acknowledged in the game. Thanks in advance!

# Why keep this repository public?
Why not? The game probably won't get much attention, but if someone finds it, they might want to help by playtesting or even contributing.
